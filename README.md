This project focuses on leveraging predictive analytics techniques to enhance supply chain security by identifying and mitigating cyber threats. By analyzing historical data and employing machine learning algorithms, the system aims to predict potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities within the supply chain, allowing organizations to proactively address security concerns and prevent disruptions.

Features
Data Collection: Collects and aggregates data from various sources such as network logs, threat intelligence feeds, and historical incident reports.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the collected data to make it suitable for analysis, including data normalization, feature engineering, and outlier detection.
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to build predictive models capable of identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of potential cyber threats.
Threat Intelligence Integration: Integrates with external threat intelligence sources to enhance the accuracy and relevance of threat predictions.
Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to emerging threats promptly.
Visualization: Generates interactive visualizations and dashboards to present insights derived from the predictive analytics process, aiding in decision-making and risk management.
Alerting System: Implements an alerting system to notify stakeholders of potential security incidents or vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention.
Scalability: Designed to scale efficiently to accommodate large volumes of data and evolving threat landscapes.
Installation
To set up the Cyber Threat Predictive Analytics system locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/cyber-threat-predictive-analytics.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd cyber-threat-predictive-analytics
npm install
Configure the settings:
Edit the configuration file (config.js) to specify data sources, machine learning models, thresholds for alerts, etc.

Run the application:
sql
Copy code
npm start
The system should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Usage
Upon accessing the application, users can:

View insights and predictions generated by the predictive analytics models.
Monitor real-time data streams for potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
Configure alerting thresholds and notification preferences.
Access historical data and trend analysis reports.
Customize dashboards and visualizations based on specific requirements.
